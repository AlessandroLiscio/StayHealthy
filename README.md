StayHealthy is a PWA (Progressive Web Application) that aims to bring patients and doctors together on a single platform.

Patients can visualize the data from their Miband wristbands (versions 2 and 3) through graphs and tables, complete questionnaires, and communicate with their doctor of choice using the messaging function provided by the application.

On the other side, along with viewing and responding to messages from his patients, a doctor will have access to all of his patients' information via charts and calendar selection.
